# NCD L2 Submission

This is essentially a clone of the starter--near-api-js repo from Learn-NEAR, with origional code only in contract.html and login.html. This is a front-end for our starter--near-sdk-as repo. A call to the contract 'GetMagicWords', passing in an integer in 'wordcount' will return an array of random words with the specified size. Also takes parameter 'extra' which is a string that gets stored to the blockchain. Requires a deposit of at least 1 yoctonear in the "money" box.
